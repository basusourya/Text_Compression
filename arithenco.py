# 
# Compression application using static arithmetic coding
# 
# Usage: python arithmetic-compress.py InputFile OutputFile
# Then use the corresponding arithmetic-decompress.py application to recreate the original input file.
# Note that the application uses an alphabet of 257 symbols - 256 symbols for the byte
# values and 1 symbol for the EOF marker. The compressed file format starts with a list
# of 256 symbol frequencies, and then followed by the arithmetic-coded data.
